# User Guide

This section covers the core workflows and concepts for using Test Case Manager effectively.

## Core Workflows

- **[Interactive Workflow](interactive-workflow.md)** - Complete guide to the interactive test case creation workflow with step-by-step examples
- **[Validation](validation.md)** - Understand test case validation, schema enforcement, and best practices

## How It Works

The Test Case Manager provides an interactive command-line interface for:

1. Creating test cases with metadata
2. Defining initial conditions
3. Building test sequences
4. Adding test steps with verification logic
5. Validating against schema
6. Integrating with git for version control

Each step in the workflow guides you through the process with prompts, validation, and helpful feedback.

## Key Concepts

- **Test Cases** - The top-level container for test definitions
- **Sequences** - Logical groupings of test steps
- **Steps** - Individual test actions with commands and expected results
- **Initial Conditions** - Prerequisites and setup requirements
- **Verification** - Automated checking of test execution results
