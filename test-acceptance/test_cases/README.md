## Variables Test Cases

The `variables/` directory contains 5 test cases demonstrating variable capture and usage:

These test cases verify the full lifecycle of variable operations:
- **Command-based captures**: Extract values by running commands (`command` field)

**Features Tested**:
- Command-based captures (wc, grep, awk, jq)
- Regex pattern extraction (tokens, IDs, metrics)
- Variable validation in general verification conditions
- Arithmetic operations with captured variables
- Complex pattern matching with multiple capture groups
- Mixed command and regex captures in same step

## Running the Acceptance Suite

To run test cases from specific categories:

```bash
# Run all tests (manual tests skipped by default)
./test-acceptance/run_acceptance_suite.sh --verbose

# Include manual tests in execution
./test-acceptance/run_acceptance_suite.sh --verbose --include-manual

# Skip specific stages
./test-acceptance/run_acceptance_suite.sh --verbose --skip-documentation
```

The acceptance suite will:
1. **Validate** all YAML files against schema
2. **Generate** bash scripts for all test cases
3. **Execute** automated tests (manual tests skipped unless `--include-manual`)
4. **Verify** execution logs against expected outcomes
5. **Validate** container YAMLs against schema
6. **Generate** documentation reports (AsciiDoc, Markdown)
7. **Consolidate** all results into unified documentation

## Notes

- All test cases are designed to be idempotent and can be run multiple times
- Test cases clean up after themselves to avoid side effects
- Cross-platform compatibility (macOS/Linux) is considered in all commands
- All regex patterns use portable POSIX syntax where possible
- Hook test cases verify both successful hook execution and proper error handling
- Hook marker files are created in /tmp to verify hook execution timing
- Manual tests are automatically skipped during acceptance suite execution
- Bash commands tests ensure generated scripts are bash 3.2+ compatible
- Variables tests verify capture, validation, and substitution workflows
