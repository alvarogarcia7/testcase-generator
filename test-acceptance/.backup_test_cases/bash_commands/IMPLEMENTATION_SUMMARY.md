## Validation Strictness

All test cases implement **strict validation** with:

1. **Result Verification**: Exit code checking for every step
2. **Output Verification**: Exact matching or regex patterns
3. **General Verification**: Additional conditions beyond result/output
4. **Variable Capture**: Regex-based and command-based capture
5. **Dynamic Validation**: Bash commands in verification expressions

### Verification Examples

```yaml
verification:
  result: "[[ $EXIT_CODE -eq 0 ]]"
  output: "[[ \"$COMMAND_OUTPUT\" == 'expected' ]]"
  general:
    - name: additional_check
      condition: "[[ $variable -eq 42 ]]"
```

## Cross-Platform Compatibility

All test cases are compatible with:
- **macOS**: BSD utilities, bash 3.2+
- **Linux**: GNU utilities, bash 3.2+

### Compatibility Features
- No bash 4.0+ specific features (no associative arrays)
- Portable regex patterns (POSIX-compliant)
- BSD/GNU command compatibility
- Fallback for platform-specific commands (e.g., stat)

## Usage

### Validate All Test Cases
```bash
for file in test-acceptance/test_cases/bash_commands/*.yaml; do
  cargo run --bin verifier -- "$file"
done
```

### Run Integration Tests
```bash
cargo test bash_commands
```

### Generate and Execute Scripts
```bash
# Generate scripts
for file in test-acceptance/test_cases/bash_commands/TC_*.yaml; do
  cargo run -- "$file"
done

# Execute scripts
for file in test-acceptance/test_cases/bash_commands/TC_*.sh; do
  bash "$file"
done
```

## Key Features

### Bash Commands in Steps
All test cases use bash commands as the primary step command:
```yaml
- step: 1
  command: "echo 'test' | grep 'test'"
```

### Bash Commands in Verification
Test cases demonstrate using bash commands in verification expressions:
```yaml
verification:
  result: "[[ $EXIT_CODE -eq 0 && $(command) -eq expected ]]"
  output: "[[ $(grep -c 'pattern' <<< \"$COMMAND_OUTPUT\") -eq 1 ]]"
```

### Bash Commands for Variable Capture
Command-based variable capture alongside regex-based:
```yaml
capture_vars:
  - name: value
    capture: '^([0-9]+)$'
  - name: computed
    command: "date +%s"
```

## Test Goal

### YAML Schema Validation

**Objective**: Validate all bash commands test case YAMLs against the schema using the `validate-yaml` binary.

**Command**:
```bash
for file in test-acceptance/test_cases/bash_commands/TC_*.yaml; do
  cargo run --bin validate-yaml -- "$file" schemas/test-case.schema.json
done
```

**Expected Result**: All 13 test case YAML files should pass schema validation without errors.

**Validation Criteria**:
- Each YAML file must be valid YAML syntax
- Each YAML file must conform to the test-case JSON schema
- All required fields must be present (requirement, item, tc, id, description, general_initial_conditions, test_sequences)
- All test sequences must have valid structure (id, name, steps)
- All steps must have required fields (step, description, command, expected, verification)
- All verification blocks must include result and output verification

**Success Metrics**:
- ✅ All 13 YAML files parse successfully
- ✅ All 13 YAML files pass schema validation
- ✅ Zero validation errors or warnings
- ✅ Exit code 0 for all validation commands

## Quality Metrics

- ✅ All test cases pass schema validation
- ✅ All test cases have strict verification (result + output)
- ✅ All test cases include general verification conditions
- ✅ All test cases use bash commands appropriately
- ✅ All test cases are cross-platform compatible
- ✅ All test cases are well-documented
- ✅ Integration tests ensure continued validation

## Test Case Complexity Distribution

- **Simple**: 1 test case (5 steps) - 4.5% of steps
- **Intermediate**: 5 test cases (49 steps) - 44.1% of steps
- **Complex**: 7 test cases (57 steps) - 51.4% of steps

## Future Enhancements

Potential additions:
- Job control test cases (bg, fg, jobs)
- Signal handling test cases (trap, kill)
- Shell options test cases (set, shopt)
- Advanced parameter expansion test cases
- Process substitution edge cases
- Co-process test cases (coproc)
