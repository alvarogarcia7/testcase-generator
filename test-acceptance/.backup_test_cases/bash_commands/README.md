- ✅ File operations (cat, cp, mv, rm, touch, chmod, stat)
- ✅ Array operations (indexed arrays, bash 3.2+ compatible)
- ✅ String manipulation (length, substring, replacement, pattern matching)
- ✅ Conditionals (if/then/else, test operators, logical operators)

## Cross-Platform Compatibility

All test cases are designed for:
- **macOS**: BSD utilities, bash 3.2+
- **Linux**: GNU utilities, bash 3.2+

### Compatibility Considerations
- Uses bash 3.2+ compatible syntax (no associative arrays)
- Avoids GNU-specific flags (e.g., uses `-E` instead of `-r` for sed)
- Portable regex patterns (POSIX-compliant)
- BSD/GNU stat command compatibility with fallback
- Tested with both BSD and GNU coreutils

## Usage

### Validate All Test Cases
```bash
for file in test-acceptance/test_cases/bash_commands/*.yaml; do
  echo "Validating $file"
  cargo run --bin verifier -- "$file" || echo "FAILED: $file"
done
```

### Generate Test Scripts
```bash
for file in test-acceptance/test_cases/bash_commands/TC_*.yaml; do
  echo "Generating script for $file"
  cargo run -- "$file"
done
```

### Execute Test Scripts
```bash
for file in test-acceptance/test_cases/bash_commands/TC_*.sh; do
  echo "Executing $file"
  bash "$file"
done
```

## Validation Features

### Step Command Execution
Commands are executed as the primary step action with strict output validation.

### Verification in Commands
Bash commands are used within verification expressions for dynamic validation:
```yaml
verification:
  result: "[[ $EXIT_CODE -eq 0 && $(command) -eq expected ]]"
  output: "[[ $(grep -c 'pattern' <<< \"$COMMAND_OUTPUT\") -eq 1 ]]"
```

### Variable Capture
Both regex-based and command-based variable capture:
```yaml
capture_vars:
  - name: value
    capture: '^([0-9]+)$'
  - name: computed
    command: "echo 'test' | wc -w"
```

### General Verification
Additional validation beyond result and output:
```yaml
verification:
  general:
    - name: check_condition
      condition: "[[ $variable -gt 0 ]]"
```

## Test Execution Integration

These test cases are integrated into the test suite through a Rust integration test that:
1. Validates YAML schema compliance
2. Generates bash scripts from YAML
3. Executes scripts and captures results
4. Verifies all assertions pass

See `tests/bash_commands_test.rs` for the integration test implementation.
