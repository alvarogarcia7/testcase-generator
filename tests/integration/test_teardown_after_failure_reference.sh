# End-to-end validation test for TCMS-9 reference test case
#
# This test validates the reference test case:
# testcases/verifier_scenarios/hooks/TEST_HOOK_TEARDOWN_001_AFTER_STEP_FAILURE.yml
#
# Validates:
# 1. Test case YAML validates against schema
# 2. Generated script has valid bash syntax
# 3. Sequence 1 step 1 fails as expected (verification intentionally returns false)
# 4. Sequence 1 step 2 is skipped after step 1 failure
# 5. Teardown hook executes despite sequence 1 step 1 failure (TCMS-9)
# 6. Teardown hook creates marker file to prove it was called
# 7. Sequence 2 successfully verifies the marker file exists
# 8. Entire test execution demonstrates TCMS-9: hooks execute even if scripts fail
#
# Usage: ./tests/integration/test_teardown_after_failure_reference.sh [--no-remove]
