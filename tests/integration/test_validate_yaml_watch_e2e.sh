# End-to-end integration test for validate-yaml watch mode
#
# This test validates:
# 1. Generate test YAML files (valid and invalid)
# 2. Start validate-yaml in watch mode in background
# 3. Modify a valid file and verify it re-validates successfully
# 4. Modify a file to be invalid and verify it reports failure
# 5. Fix the invalid file and verify full validation runs when all files pass
# 6. Clean up the background process
# 7. Skip test on Windows (watch mode not supported)
#
# Usage: ./tests/integration/test_validate_yaml_watch_e2e.sh
