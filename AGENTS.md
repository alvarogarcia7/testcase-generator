# AGENTS.md

## Commands
- **Build**: make build
- **Lint**: make lint
- **Test**: make test
- **Watch Mode**: make watch (monitors testcases/ for changes and auto-validates)
- **Dev Server**: N/A

You must build, test, and lint before committing

## Binaries

The project includes several binary utilities:

- **json-escape**: A utility that reads from stdin and performs JSON string escaping. Supports a test mode (`--test`) to validate that escaped output is valid JSON when wrapped in quotes, and verbose mode (`--verbose`) for detailed logging.
  - Build: `make build-json-escape`
  - Run: `make run-json-escape` or `cargo run --bin json-escape`
  - Usage: `echo "text" | json-escape`

## Shell Script Compatibility

**MANDATORY**: All shell scripts and generated bash scripts must be compatible with both BSD and GNU variants of command-line tools, and must work with bash 3.2+ (the default on macOS).

### Key Requirements:
- Scripts must work on macOS (BSD) and Linux (GNU) without modification
- Scripts must be compatible with bash 3.2+ (macOS ships with bash 3.2 by default)
- Avoid GNU-specific flags or options that don't exist in BSD variants
- Avoid bash 4.0+ features like associative arrays (`declare -A`)
- Test commands like `sed`, `grep`, `awk`, `find`, etc. must use portable syntax
- When using regex, ensure patterns are compatible with both POSIX and GNU extended regex
- Use POSIX-compliant shell constructs where possible

### Common Pitfalls:
- `grep -P` (Perl regex) is GNU-only - use `sed -n` with capture groups instead
- `sed -r` is GNU-only - use `sed -E` for BSD/macOS compatibility
- `date` formatting differs between BSD and GNU
- `readlink -f` is GNU-only - use alternative methods for BSD
- `declare -A` (associative arrays) requires bash 4.0+ - use eval with dynamic variable names for bash 3.2+

### Testing:
- Test generated scripts on both macOS and Linux when possible
- Use portable regex patterns that work with both implementations
- Verify scripts work with bash 3.2 (default on macOS)

## Testing Requirements

**MANDATORY**: All agents must run the full test suite before considering any task complete. Testing is a critical step that cannot be skipped.

### Test Execution
- Run tests using: `cargo test --all-features`
- This ensures comprehensive validation across the entire codebase with all feature flags enabled
- Alternative basic test command: `cargo test`

### Test Requirements
- **All tests must pass** before any code changes can be committed
- If tests fail, investigate and fix the failures before proceeding
- Never commit code with failing tests
- Update or add tests as needed when modifying functionality
